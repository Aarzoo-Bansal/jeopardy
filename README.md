## Game Screens

### 1. Configure Game
The host sets a custom game title, selects which categories to include, and chooses difficulty levels. Categories show question counts with color-coded indicators.

### 2. Add Teams
Add up to 12 teams with custom names and emoji avatars. Teams persist when navigating back to config.

### 3. Game Board
Dynamic grid showing only selected categories and difficulties. Click cells to open questions. The board adapts to any number of categories with horizontal scrolling on mobile.

### 4. Admin Panel
Accessible at `/admin`. Manage all categories and questions. Inline editing, collapsible groups, and category filtering.

## Key Design Decisions

- **SQLite over PostgreSQL** — File-based, zero configuration, portable. Perfect for single-server deployment. Migration to PostgreSQL planned for Phase 2 (multi-user).
- **Random question selection** — If a category has multiple questions at the same difficulty, one is randomly picked each game session. More questions = more replayability.
- **Component extraction** — GameConfig and TeamsSetup extracted as separate components with callback props. Game board stays in JeopardyGame due to tight coupling with modals and scoring.
- **CSS animations over JS** — All animations (particles, confetti, cell entrance, score pops) use CSS `@keyframes` for GPU-accelerated performance.
- **Flat grid layout** — Game board uses CSS Grid with `gridTemplateRows: "auto repeat(n, 1fr)"` so all category headers auto-match the tallest one.

---

## What's Next (Phase 2)

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the full product roadmap.

- User authentication (sign up, log in, JWT)
- Multi-tenancy (each user owns their categories/questions)
- PostgreSQL migration for persistent multi-user data
- Deploy to Render
